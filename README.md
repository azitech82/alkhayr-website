# Akademi Al Khayr Homepage

This project is a school homepage design inspired by the WRO Association categories page layout.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main landing page containing the academic programs grid.

## Design Inspiration
The layout mimics the structure of [WRO Association Categories](https://wro-association.org/competition/categories/):
- **Hero Section**: Title and introductory text.
- **Grid Layout**: 2-column grid on desktop (responsive to 1-column on mobile).
- **Card Design**:
  - Color-coded borders (Purple, Blue, Amber, Purple) representing different school levels.
  - "Quick Facts" table replacing the technical specs (Age, Hardware, etc.).
  - Iconography using FontAwesome.
  - "More Information" CTA button at the bottom.

## How to View
Open `index.html` in any modern web browser. The styling is handled via Tailwind CSS (CDN), so an internet connection is required.
